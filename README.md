# Scientific Python @ SISEO
June 15, 16 and 17 2020

## Program
The module has 6 half days. From a pre-established skeleton, the training gradually becomes oriented to meet the specific needs / ideas of the group.

- Half Day 1, 2, 3: Introduction to Python:
    - [x] Work Environments: Spyder, Jupyter.
    - [x] Basic programming in Python.
    - [x] Scientific and graphic libraries for the scientist Numpy, Scipy, Pandas and Matplotlib.
    - [x] Various examples.
- Half day 4: Libraries and documentation
    - [x] Creation of a documented library
    - [x] Document it with Sphinx in collaborative mode with Git and GitLab.
- Half-days 5:  "A la carte" themes. Examples:
    - [x] Advanced graphics for publications with Matplotlib (complex graphics, Latex couplings),
    - [x] Image processing / Computed vision,
    - [x] Optimization,
    - [x] Numerical resolution of ordinary differential equations,
    - [x] Machine / Deep Learning (Scikit Learn, PyTorch) â€¦
- Half-day 6: Realization of a project:
    - [x] Each participant proposes to solve a problem with the proposed methods. At the end of this session, the project is realized as a GitLab or GitHub repository.

## Needs

- [x] Basics
- [x] General purpose stuff
- [x] Data management with Pandas
- [x] Image processing (SEM, TEM ?)
- [x] Figures with Matplotlib
- [x] Jupyter vs. Spyder
- [x] Classes !
- [x] GUIs
- [x] Git
